# Pokémon Emerald Warp Randomizer

This is a randomizer for nearly all warps in Pokémon Emerald, written in C#.

To play with your own Seeds, you'll need to build the game yourself ([Take a look at the original decomp project for more infos on how to build pokeemerald.gba](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald)), but I will provide a few .ips-Patches for everyone to use.
